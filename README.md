# collision
Fun little project I'm doing, reinventing the wheel straight from my dome.

There are no graphics, and I've never actually tested it. But hello world prints, so that's good.

My dream is to be working on this sometime, and have a random person walk by and think "Aww, hello world, he's learning to code, that's so cute.". Meanwhile I'm pouring 100% of my monkey brain into making collision logic for objects I've never typed out, with graphics I'll never see.
